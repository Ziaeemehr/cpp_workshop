Exercises from "Programming &ndash; Principles and Practice using C++" by Stroustrup
==============

Exercises from Stroustrup's ["Programming &ndash; Principles and Practice Using C++" (First Edition)](http://www.informit.com/store/programming-principles-and-practice-using-c-plus-plus-9780321543721). Some sample solutions by Stroustrup can be found [here](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html). The directory **ppt\_slides** contains the *old* version of the slides on [Stroustrup's website](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/lecture-slides.html), as the current ones are updated for the 2nd edition of the book and C++11. In **code_snippets**, there are all the code examples in the book, taken from [the book's website](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP1.html).

I was working with Visual Studio 2013 Express for Chapters 1&ndash;18, then I changed to [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org). Everything I've uploaded here was tested to compile in Code::Blocks using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) GCC 4.8.1. From Chapter 21 on, I switched to Visual Studio Community 2013.

Chapter 1 has no programming exercises, and for Chapter 2 I just went along and changed the same file over and over, so these solutions are not here.

Chapters 12&ndash;16 deal with GUI/graphics and use [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/index.php). The actual work there is not in the files containing `main`, but in **lib\_files/Graph.cpp** and **lib\_files/Simple_window.cpp**. I've done a little write-up about setting up FLTK under Visual Studio Community 2013 [here](http://bewuethr.github.io/installing-fltk-133-under-visual-studio/).
